# PM2.5 Levels in Urban vs. Rural Counties in California

This project investigates PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) pollution in California by comparing urban and rural counties. The analysis combines air quality data from the EPA with population data from the U.S. Census to explore how pollution levels differ based on county type.

## 📚 Background

PM2.5 pollution has well-documented links to cardiovascular and respiratory health issues. This project draws from existing environmental health literature to highlight disparities in pollution exposure and potential public health concerns, especially for rural communities.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- EPA Air Quality System (AQS) API
- U.S. Census population datasets
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Highlights

- Urban counties tend to show **higher PM2.5 levels** on average, but rural counties have **notable seasonal peaks**
- PM2.5 trends visualized over time across multiple counties
- Merged EPA pollution data with Census population estimates
- Created bar charts, box plots, and time series to compare urban vs. rural trends
